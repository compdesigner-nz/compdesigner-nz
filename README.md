- 👋 Hi, I’m @compdesigner-nz
- 👀 I’m interested in computational design, software development and the world of the AEC industry.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, C#, js, html, css and R.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much at the moment. This is just a profile for my hobbie projects. 
I have a professional job doing computational design and that is where I collaborate. You can find out more here: [Aurecon](https://www.aurecon.com)
